# Face-RocognitionAttendance-system
In This project I Have Designed Web Application With Machine Learning For Face Rocognition Based Attendance system

Steps to run : 
Sure, here are the steps to execute your multi-face recognition-based attendance system project:

1. Install Required Libraries: First, ensure that you have all the required libraries installed. You mentioned Python, OpenCV, Flask, NumPy, and Pandas. Make sure they are installed using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python flask numpy pandas
    ```
2. Gather Data: Collect images of the faces of the people whose attendance you want to record. It's important to have a good variety of images with different lighting conditions, angles, and facial expressions for better recognition accuracy.
3. Preprocess Images: Use OpenCV to preprocess the images. Common preprocessing steps include converting images to grayscale, resizing, and normalizing.

4. Train the Model: Use a machine learning algorithm for face recognition. Popular choices include Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, or more modern approaches like deep learning-based models (using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch). Train the model with the preprocessed images.

5. Build Flask Web Application:
    - Create a directory structure for your Flask application.
    - Set up routes for different functionalities (e.g., home page, attendance recording, etc.).
    - Implement HTML templates for the UI.
    - Use Flask to handle requests and responses.

6. Integrate Face Recognition with Flask:
    - Create a route for face recognition.
    - Use OpenCV to capture images from the camera.
    - Preprocess the captured image.
    - Use the trained model to recognize faces.
    - Return the recognized faces with confidence levels.

7. Record Attendance:
    - Create a database (you can use SQLite with Pandas or other databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    - When a face is recognized, log the attendance in the database along with the timestamp.

8. Display Attendance:
    - Create a route to display the attendance records.
    - Query the database to fetch attendance records.
    - Display the attendance records on a webpage.

9. Testing:
    - Test your application thoroughly. Ensure that face recognition is accurate and attendance is being recorded correctly.
    - Test for various scenarios, including different lighting conditions, different faces, and multiple faces at once.

10. Deployment:
    - Once testing is successful, deploy your Flask application. You can use platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any other hosting service.
    - Make sure to configure the server properly for production.

11. Documentation:
    - Document your project. Include details about how to use it, how it's built, and any other relevant information.
    - Provide instructions for future development or troubleshooting.

12. Maintenance:
    - Regularly update your project to improve accuracy and security.
    - Monitor the application for any issues and fix them promptly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully execute your multi-face recognition-based attendance system project.

Short Steps To Execute A Program : 
1.	Run A Main Python File (Flask App)
2.	Click On Link That Appears On Vscode Terminal.
3.	Take A Facial Pictures For Registering A New User.
4.	For Marking An Attendance Click On Take Attendance Button
5.	After Performing All Such Steps You Can See Marked Attendance On GUI Or CSV File.
